# Google Classroom Dark Theme V2

I decided to create my own dark theme for Google Classroom because Dark Reader isn't perfect, and there is no good style that has the following:
- Currently works
- Doesn't interfere with class accent color
- Has enough contrast to read

The [old style](<../Google Classroom Dark Theme/README.md>)'s code had a lot of unneccesary stuff, was old, and broke with a UI update,
so I rewrote the entire theme from scratch. This version has more customizations.
